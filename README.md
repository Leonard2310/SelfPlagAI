# SelfPlag AI



The rise of **Large Language Models** has transformed natural language processing, enabling high-quality text generation at scale. As these models are increasingly used to produce publicly available content, a key issue emerges: **what happens when LLMs are trained on data largely generated by other LLMs?** This recursive use of synthetic data introduces the risk of **model collapse**, a phenomenon where models progressively lose alignment with real human language.
**SelfPlag AI** explores the long-term impact of recursive training on LLMs, focusing on **question-answering tasks**. By simulating multiple generations of fine-tuning using AI-generated data, the project analyzes how output quality degrades over time â€” in terms of coherence, factual accuracy, and linguistic diversity. The goal is to provide empirical evidence of performance decay and highlight the risks of uncontrolled self-learning loops.

Model collapse arises when generative models, repeatedly trained on their own outputs, shift away from the true language distribution. Early collapse affects rare but informative patterns; later stages lead to **homogenized, low-variance outputs**. This degradation is driven by statistical, expressive, and optimization-related errors that **accumulate across generations**, threatening the sustainability and reliability of future LLMs.
